     My history in IT started back in the middle of 90s where I began gaining

     not only in IT that gave me leading skills and was repeatedly noted by
     the management for high competence and involvement in the job. Logically,
     I have decided to focus on my IT career that pushed me to graduate Level 7
      in IT here in NZ with average A grade and Honors. So I am aimed to growth in IT field.
