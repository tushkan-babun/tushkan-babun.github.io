<div class="blurb">

  <p>My name is Aleksei Petukhov. I was born in a small town in Sakhalin
  -region, Russia, but for the last 13 years before I arrived to New Zealand
  -I had been living and working in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the Capital of the
  -Sakhalin Island.</p>
  -<p>Back in the middle of 90s my father, a boat radio operator then,
  -used to take me to his fishing boat. His work station was cutting-edge and
  -I loved exploring his equipment and seeing all those devices work.
  -I barely knew how to read and write in English,
  -still I enjoyed using his laptop with operational systems such as
  -DOS and Windows 3.1 installed.</p>
  -<p>Later in my 6th grade I developed a keen interest in IT when
  -I started attending an additional PC literacy course. In a little more than
  -a year I acquired fundamental knowledge in C-basic, HTML, Web-design, PHP, etc.
  -I came to know what computer coding is and later created some simple web pages
  -both for myself and my friends. I was so much captivated by it,
  -that my teacher offered me a temporary position of his assistant to help
  -him with other students. Also I managed to assemble a server,
  -which gave me a deeper insight into how a computer worked.
  -</p>
  -<p>Despite my most obvious interest to computers,
  -I enrolled into and later graduated from Sakhalin State University with
  -a degree in Geography. At the time I considered this profession to be the
  -most promising choice for a person living in Sakhalin.
  -</p>
  -<p>I got my first job when I was yet a student.
  -It was an internship work as SHE assistant at the large construction
  -organization in Russia LLC “StarStroi”. Since then and until present I
  -have been working in the Safety, Health and Environmental field.
  -I have brushed up on my skills and having quite well career progression
  -at International Oil & Gas Project on Sakhalin Island.
  -I have 6 years of experience in this field with Russian and international companies.
  -</p>
  -<p>However, I have never lost my interest in IT. The knowledge of IT I had
  -acquired has come in useful all along. Most recently,
  -I have been using my skills for making b-rolls (supplemental footage)
  -through professional applications. I am trying to contribute,
  -to the extent I can, to Technical and IT teams at work, getting involved in
  -any event related to the world of IT. I am sure that my power user skills
  -contribute remarkably to my overall success at work as they allow me to
  -improve the quality and speed of information handling.
  -</p>
  -<p>Since recently I started thinking about continuing my education in IT
  -and brining it to a professional level. I can clearly see the lacks and
  -gaps in our department work in terms of processing information and the ways
  -I could contribute into improving it if I had the necessary knowledge of how
  -to develop and, most importantly, implement certain specialized software.
  -In my opinion, the future of my profession will require new methods of harvest,
  -analysis and information output.
  -</p>
  -<p>I have just finished course Graduate Diploma in IT at Concordia Institute
  -of Business (Aspire2 International) with some distinction.
  -The main reason why I had chosen this program is that it is specifically
  -designed for people who come from non-IT background and want to get into
  -software development. The course includes core papers such as System
  -Development Integration, Programming, Data Base Design Development that really
  -gave me the specific knowledge I needed to deal with large amount of data and
  -tought me how to develop and properly implement new software.

  -<p>There was my brief bio. I have also my CV with my specific knowledge and expertise in IT.</p>
